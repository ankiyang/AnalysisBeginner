##main points

A process can consist of multi threads.

Normally, the creation and management of a thread by the operating system is less expensive in terms of CPU's resources than the creation and management of a process.
Threads are used for small tasks, whereas processes are used for more heavyweight tasks -- basically, the execution of applications.

The threads of the same process share the address space and other resources, while processes are independent of each other.
